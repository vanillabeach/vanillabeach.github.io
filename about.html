        <h2>About John-Paul Holt</h2>
        <p class="bold">I am a web and mobile developer, and UX Engineer based in London, UK.</p>
        <p class="bold">
          I specialise in great front-end architecture, from collaborating with designers and brand engineers, to
          figuring out the best technical solutions for building the user interface. This might involve building a
          prototype, or iterating on existing code, or even reacting to unexpected changes and determining the best way
          forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I come from a strong coding background and have a passion for building websites in my spare time. I enjoy
          experimenting with new frameworks and emerging technologies such as WebGL and Canvas. Experience has taught me
          about the power of innovation when it comes to solving problems, and that custom solutions often go
          hand-in-hand with third party libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like
          <a href="https://dribbble.com/vanillabeach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">creating artwork</a> and enjoy
          drawing and photography in my spare time. I find myself using visual tools to help solve problems, whether it
          <img src="" alt="" srcset="" />s using Photoshop, Figma, or just sketching on a post-it note. This puts me in
          a unique position whereby I feel comfortable working with both Software Engineers and UX Designers, especially
          when we look of improving the collaboration between the teams through better processes and understanding.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideal Job Roles</h2>
        <p>I like working within the research space, with particular interest in the following:</p>
        <span class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Helping research scientists visualise their algorithms.</li>
          <li>
            Building case tools to provide more accurate training data, whether it's a web/mobile app, browser
            extension, or API.
          </li>
          <li>Creating prototypes to test research.</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="bold">Clinical / Healthcare</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Working on Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) systems to improve patient outcomes.</li>
          <li>Collaborating with clinicians on research, including DICOM and medical imaging.</li>
          <li>Creation of hospital dashboards and "sense making" of complex clinical data.</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="bold">General Research & Productisation</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Visualisation of complex/difficult problems.</li>
          <li>Creation of Design Systems to create a more cohesive UI across apps as well as devices.</li>
          <li>Exploration of emerging technologies within the web/mobile space.</li>
          <li>
            Deploying commercial-grade apps that meet public requirements (including accessibility and
            internationalisation).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The above is not a comprehensive list of preferences; I'm interested in any job that offers a chance to
          architect and build the UI for something innovative regardless of business domain.
        </p>
